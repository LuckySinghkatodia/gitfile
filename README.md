Project Title: Analysis and Manipulation of Data in Pytho


Description
This Python sample uses the pandas package to show several data manipulation and analysis approaches. It covers things like naming and rearranging columns, grouping data, concatenating dataframes, adding additional columns, and utilising case statements to build conditional logic.

Getting start
Requirements
You must have Python installed on your computer in addition to the following libraries in order to execute this code:
- numpy - pandas


Setting Up
Pip can be used to install the necessary libraries:

pip install numpy and pandas

## Running the Tests
### Breakdown of Tests
1.Creating new colunmns:- This section shows how to add additional columns to a pandas DataFrame, including how to calculate values depending on pre-existing columns and establish default values.

2. *Concatenating Dataframes*: This code demonstrates how to join two DataFrames together vertically.

3. *Renaming and Reordering Columns*: Name changes and column reordering in a DataFrame are covered in this section.

 4: *Groupby, Case WHEN, and WHERE*: This part demonstrates several data manipulation methods, including data grouping, row filtering, and conditional logic implementation with case statements.
 
 Deployment
Any Python environment with access to pandas and numpy libraries can use this code. It can be applied to ad hoc data manipulation activities or combined with pipelines for data analysis.
